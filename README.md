# Star Junkers
A one-page RPG in which players take on the roles of the crew of a rundown salvage vessel taking jobs as they come across the StellarComm. Itâ€™s dirty and dangerous work, but it beats mining asteroids, waiting in line for water rations, or fighting the aliens some diplomat insulted because his hand twitched the wrong way.
